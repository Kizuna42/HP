# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This repository contains materials for Aeterlink's corporate homepage project. The project is focused on creating a brand-driven website that emphasizes first impressions and conveys Aeterlink's company culture through strategic design and messaging.

## Repository Structure

- `HP用素材/` - Design assets including company logos (AL logo variants), product images (sensors, powerTX), and AirPlug branding
- `docs/` - Strategic documentation and requirements

## Project Context

### Strategic Focus
The project prioritizes brand impression over functional features, with emphasis on:
- Hero section and branding elements as primary differentiators
- AI-generated content optimization for "Aeterlink-ness" 
- Visual impact through image generation rather than comprehensive site development

### Brand Archetypes
The brand strategy incorporates multiple archetypes including Sage, Hero, Sustainable, Creator, Explorer, and Magician, with optimization goals of maximizing brand recognition × favorability × profitability.

### Development Philosophy
- Design-driven approach over coding-first methodology
- AI capabilities focused on image generation and brand messaging
- Data-driven brand definition through company culture analysis
- Hero section iteration and A/B testing prioritized over full site development

## Current State

**Phase 1 Complete**: Comprehensive public information analysis has been completed, resulting in confirmed requirements and brand strategy for the new HP. The repository now contains:

- **Confirmed Brand Archetype**: Hero : Sustainable (65% : 35%)
- **Finalized Hero Section Strategy**: Core message, visual direction, and color palette established
- **Complete Requirements Definition**: Technical, design, and content specifications ready for implementation

## Key Strategic Decisions

### Brand Positioning
**"Responsible Technological Innovation"** - Differentiated from both 20s startups and large enterprises

### Hero Section Strategy (Confirmed)
- **Core Message**: 「ワイヤレス給電で、未来をつなぐ。」
- **Sub Message**: 「スタンフォード大学発の革新技術で、配線のないデジタル社会を実現。AirPlugが創る新しいインフラが、あなたのビジネスを次のステージへ。」
- **Color Palette**: Deep Blue (#1B365D), Electric Blue (#0084FF), Lime Green (#00D564)

### Technical Requirements
- Performance: 3-second initial load time
- Mobile-first responsive design (768px/480px breakpoints)
- Tech stack: HTML5/CSS3/Vanilla JavaScript
- Target KPIs: <50% bounce rate, >2min session time, >5% conversion rate

Future development should prioritize hero section implementation based on the confirmed strategy outlined in `docs/公開情報分析結果.md`.
